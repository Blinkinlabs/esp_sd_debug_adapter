A connector to allow you to debug an ESP32 through the MicroSD connector on your board. Note that the MicroSD card slot needs to be wired with a 4-wire SDMMC connection for this to work, and that your target firmware needs to disable the SDMMC pins for this to work.

It's designed to work with JTAG adapters such as the [ESP-Prog Board](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/evaluation_boards/ESP-Prog_guide_en.md) from Espressif.
